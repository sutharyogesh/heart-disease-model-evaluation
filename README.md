# Heart Disease Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning

This project trains and evaluates multiple ML models to predict heart disease using the UCI dataset. 
It compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN classifiers and uses hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV).
